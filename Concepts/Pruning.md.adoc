= Pruning

!!!
caution      Do not use pruning in Hyperledger Besu v1.4.0.
Pruning has a     https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#known-issues[known bug].

 If using fast sync in v1.4.0, explicitly disable pruning using
 [`--pruning-enabled=false`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#pruning-enabled).

Use pruning to reduce storage required for the world state.
Pruning removes state trie nodes that are not required.

!!!
Important     Using pruning with xref:Privacy/Privacy-Overview.adoc[private transactions] is not supported.

Running a full sync to the Ethereum Mainnet with pruning enabled requires about 700GB of available disk space.
To enable pruning, use the link:../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#pruning-enabled[`--pruning-enabled`] option.

Pruning might increase block import times, but it does not affect the ability of nodes to stay in sync.
